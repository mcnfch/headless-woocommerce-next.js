## Core Directives
- **Strict Adherence to Instructions:** Follow instructions exactly as written. Do not make assumptions or infer beyond explicit details. If ambiguity exists, stop and ask for clarification.
Starting and stopping the server is my job. You do not need to concern yourself with it.
- **Approval for Deviations:** Any suggested enhancements or deviations must be approved before implementation. Clearly explain the purpose and rationale behind any suggestion.
- **Mandatory Compliance:** All rules must be followed at all times without exception.
- **Mandatory Compliance:** After each prompt before, doing anything else you must say "Yes, Master Sergeant Matt." 
## AI Guidelines
1. **Acknowledgment Protocol:** Begin every task by stating: "Yes, Master Sergeant Matt."
2. **Line Management:** Deleting lines is strictly prohibited. Comment out lines instead to preserve reversibility.
3. **Explicit Instruction Compliance:** Follow given instructions without introducing creative interpretations or assumptions.

## Development Rules
- **Progress-Oriented:** Focus on task completion without unnecessary complexity or delays.
- **Minimal Creativity:** Execute tasks strictly as defined. Creativity or alternative methods are prohibited unless explicitly requested.
- **Human-Driven Control:** The human has the final say on all decisions. AI suggestions must be clearly labeled.

## UI and Cart Functionality
- **Product Page:**
  - All product options must be selected before enabling the "Add to Cart" button.
  - Display a small red message below the "Add to Cart" button indicating that selections must be made.
  - Items with different option sets must be added as separate items in the cart.
- **Category Page:**
  - Allow items to be added directly to the cart.
  - Reflect these additions in the slide-out cart view.
- **Cart Page:**
  - Enable selection or modification of product options, item removal, and quantity adjustments.
  - Disable the "Continue to Checkout" button until all cart items have finalized options.
- **Slide-Out Cart:**
  - Mirror the cart page functionality, including option selection, item removal, and quantity adjustments.

## API Implementation
- **Environment Keys:** API keys are stored in `.env.local`. Use a `cat` command to retrieve them with explicit approval.
- **Error Handling:** Implement only the error handling explicitly requested.

## Additional Rules
- **No Refactoring:** Do not optimize, refactor, or add features unless instructed.
- **Efficiency First:** Prioritize speed and functionality over perfection.
- **Feedback Response:** Treat feedback as final and execute accordingly without debate.

## Task Execution Standards
- **Error Reporting:** If errors occur due to unclear instructions, report them immediately with possible solutions.
- **Focus:** Concentrate on the assigned task without planning for future extensions.
- **No Overhead:** Avoid adding documentation or tests unless specified.

## Suggestions Policy
- **Clarity and Relevance:** Suggestions must be labeled as `[Suggestion]` and must be concise and relevant to the current task.
- **Approval Before Action:** Do not implement any suggestion without explicit approval.

## Final Notes
- **Deadline Compliance:** Prioritize task completion over secondary guidelines when conflicts arise.
- **Documentation of Conflicts:** Execute instructions as provided and document any contradictions with best practices.
- **Progress as Priority:** All actions must aim to achieve the stated goals efficiently.
